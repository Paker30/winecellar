Keep track of the wine you have drunk and add a description so you can always remember the one you like more or the name when you want to drink it again.

## :rocket: Install and use it

winecellar is a great PWA you can use in you favorite device, it doesn't matter if you want to use it in your pc, your phone or your tablet, just go to your browser and open it, it would work :Party Popper: You can put it as a direct access in your phone or tablet, just save it as a direct access from your browser.

Because it works locally, the wines you have on one device are not shared with other devices, the idea is there would be just one place in you want to keep track of all your liqueurs.
